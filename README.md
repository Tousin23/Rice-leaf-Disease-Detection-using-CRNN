# Rice leaf Disease Detection using CRNN
* This repositiry contains the model used fo this project
* Along with the code the results are also uploaded showing the performance of our model
* CRNN is used here to where CNN is used to capture the high-level local features of the leaf and RNN is used to capture the features that changes overtime.
* Therefore, CRNN helps us to capture the spatial as well as temporal features, and give a better performance than existing techniques.
